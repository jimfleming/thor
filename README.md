Thor
====

A Finagle-based image processor.

NOTE: JDK7 or higher required. Run `java -version` and check that it shows at least 1.7 or update here http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Installation
---

1. Clean the repo: `git clone https://github.com/rdio/thor.git`
2. Add your `application.conf` to the root of resources and configure a media host (see `reference.conf` for default properties or https://github.com/typesafehub/config/ for more documentation)
3. Run the app: `sbt run`
4. Navigate to a valid relative path on your media provider `http://localhost:8080/?l=<path>` to verify that its working

Querystring Params
---

- `w` - width of the final image
- `h` - height of the final image
- `c` - compression quality to apply to jpeg image results (0-100)
  - NOTE: File format is chosen automatically based on whether or not a filter or layer utilizes transparency. This may change.
- `l` - `<layer>[; <layer>]+` - a sequence of one or more layers separated by a semi-colon: `;`
  - layer - `<source>[:<filter>]|<filter>` - a layer consists of a single image source and an optional filter separated by a colon: `:`, or a single filter without a source
    - source - `<url>|$<index>|_` - either a relative url path or a layer reference or an empty layer
      - url - any relative url accessible by the media provider
      - layer reference - `$<index>` - zero-based index into any _preceeding_ layer
      - empty layer â€” `_` - a blank layer the size of the final output with pixels initialized to fully transparent
    - filter - `<filter-name>([args])` - filter to apply to the current layer or if no source was provided, the previous layer
      - linear gradient - `linear(<angle>, <color-stop>, <color-stop> [, <color-stop>]+)` - applies a linear gradient over the layer at `<angle>` degrees with _at least_ two color stops
        - color stop - `<rgb|rgba> <percentage>%` - supports either rgb or rgba colors
      - blur - `blur()` - blurs the image
      - boxblur - `blur(<horizontal-radius-pixels>, <vertical-radius-pixels>)` - applies a box blur to the image by `radius-pixels`
      - scale - `scale(<percent>%)` - resizes the image by `percent`
      - scaleto - `scaleto(<width-pixels>, <height-pixels>)` - resizes the image to the specified dimensions
      - grid - `grid(<source>[, <source>]+)` - forms a grid from the list of source images (original layer included in the grid)
      - round - `round(<radius-pixels>px)` - rounds the corners of the layer by `radius-pixels`
      - pad - `pad(<padding-pixels>)` - applies padding around the image by `padding-pixels`
      - colorize - `colorize(<color>)` - overlays the specified `color` over the image
      - overlay - `overlay(<source>)` - overlays the specified `source` over the image
      - mask - `mask(<overlay-source>, <mask-source>)` - blends between the layer and `overlay-source` using `mask-source` as a guide
